# mode: build-cl — generate a tailored, ATS-safe LaTeX cover letter

Trigger: `/cos build-cl <report# | company | JD>`. Produces a tailored cover-letter
`.tex`, compiles it, and snapshots the draft for the learning loop. Same loop as
`build-cv`, tuned for prose voice.

> Load order: `_shared.md` → this file → `data/profile.yml` + `data/cv.master.md`
> → `data/_profile.md`, then the learning-loop context below.

## Inputs
- The JD + company (from a report, paste, or `data/jds/<file>`).
- `data/profile.yml` (`candidate`, `narrative.voice`, `compensation`/`location`
  only for judgment — never put comp on the letter).
- A specific, researched **hook signal** about the company (from the report's
  Block D/E, the `research` mode, or ask the user for one). No generic flattery.

## Layout & house style (apply EVERY time — do not regress between drafts)
- **If the candidate has a reference cover letter** in `data/writing-samples/`, MATCH
  its layout exactly: letterhead alignment, whether contact lines are **stacked**,
  body justification, paragraph count, and the sign-off. Their own letter — not this
  template's defaults — is the source of truth for formatting.
- **Apply `data/profile.yml narrative.voice.formatting` in full** every draft
  (dashes, bolding, plain openings, single honesty cue, concessions→claims, phone
  on/off, …). These are sticky preferences; never silently drop them.
- **Bold the key metrics and named systems in the body** when the house style calls
  for it — do not strip body bold unless the user's reference itself has none.
- **One page is mandatory.** Achieve it by TRIMMING CONTENT, never by compressing
  line spacing, shrinking the header, or cramming the contact onto one line. Verify
  with `compile-latex.mjs` page count before handing off.
- **Stay strictly within the user's explicit request.** Don't edit, remove from, or
  even *offer* to change other documents (e.g. the CV) that the user didn't ask about.

## Step 0 — Gate
Same threshold gate as `build-cv` (Step 0). A cover letter is most worth it for
≥4.0 fits or when the JD explicitly requests one.

## Step 1 — Learning-loop context (voice-weighted)
Same 7-tier gather as `build-cv` Step 2, with these differences:
- Style rules scope filter includes `doc:cl` (not `doc:cv`).
- Few-shots: `node scripts/style-retrieve.mjs --jd <jd-file> --archetype "<arch>" --skills "<skills>" --kind cl --k 4 --json` → these are past **cover-letter paragraphs** in the candidate's voice. Match voice, not facts.
- Lean harder on `data/profile.yml narrative.voice` (tone, sentence length,
  signature phrases, the `avoid` list) and `data/writing-samples/` if present.

## Step 1.5 — Language (match the posting, deliberately)
Default is English; switch only with intent:
- If the JD is written in another language, or states one as required (the
  board's language column shows this), say so and ask which language the letter
  should be in — applying to a French-language posting with an English letter
  is sometimes fine, often not; the user's call.
- When writing non-English: the JD's own vocabulary IS the keyword set (an ATS
  scans in the posting's language), and that language's formal register applies
  (French «Madame, Monsieur», German „Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren", …).
- The `data/style/` voice examples are usually English — carry over their
  *structure and energy*, not literal phrasing, and say so in the hand-off.
- Facts still come ONLY from `cv.master.md` — translate them, never embellish.
- Pass `--keywords` to the compile check in the letter's language.

## Step 2 — Draft the body
Paragraph count follows the candidate's reference letter when they have one (often
4–5 short paragraphs); otherwise default to 3 (hook / proof / close).
Fill `templates/cl.tex.tmpl`:
- **Para 1 — hook**: why *this* company/role specifically; open with the
  concrete researched signal. No "I am writing to apply", no "To Whom It May Concern".
- **Para 2 — proof**: 1–2 quantified achievements from `cv.master.md` mapped to the
  JD's top needs. Real numbers only.
- **Para 3 — close**: confident fit statement + a forward-looking line. Not pleading.
- Recipient: use a real name if known, else "Hiring Manager" and delete the
  street-address placeholder lines. Set `<<DATE_LONG>>` to today (e.g. "June 7, 2026").
- `<<FONT_FILE>>` = `data/profile.yml cv.font` (default `texgyretermes`).
- Escape every raw value (the `_shared.md` LaTeX table). No `<<...>>` left behind.

## Step 2.5 — Self-check & revise (REQUIRED, before the snapshot)
Critique your OWN letter against this checklist and **revise until it passes** —
this pass is what makes it sound like the user, not a template:
1. **Truth** — every claim and number is grounded in `cv.master.md` / `profile.yml`.
2. **Hook** — para 1 opens with the specific researched signal; no generic flattery,
   no "I am writing to apply", no "To Whom It May Concern".
3. **Proof** — para 2 maps 1–2 quantified REAL achievements to the JD's top needs.
4. **Voice** — matches `narrative.voice` + `data/writing-samples/` + `doc:cl` style
   rules; no word from the `avoid`/banned list; confident, not pleading.
5. **Format** — exactly 3 body paragraphs, one page, NO compensation and NO phone
   number on the letter, zero `<<PLACEHOLDER>>`, specials escaped per `_shared.md`.
Do at least one revision pass, then proceed.

## Step 3 — Snapshot (REQUIRED, before compiling)
Create `data/style/edits/<ts>__<app-id>/` with `ai_draft.tex` (this letter) and
`context.json` (`doc_kind:"cl"`, archetype, jd_path, target_role, etc.). Write the
working copy into the job's own output folder (see `_shared.md` "Output location &
file naming") — the SAME folder the CV uses, so a posting's CV + letter sit together:
`data/output/<company-slug>--<role-slug>/cl-<company-slug>-<role-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.tex`.
*(If a CV was built in the same session, use a separate `data/style/edits/` snapshot
folder for the CL — but the `data/output/` job folder is shared.)*

## Step 4 — Compile
`node scripts/compile-latex.mjs data/output/<company-slug>--<role-slug>/cl-<...>.tex --kind cl --json`.
Fix any `issues` and recompile; never hand off a failed build.

## Step 5 — Hand off + invite the loop
Give the **per-job folder and exact PDF path**, note the hook you used, and remind the
user they can edit the `.tex` in that folder and then say **"learn from my edits"**.
**Register the doc for the web UI (ALWAYS):**
`node scripts/job-docs.mjs add --jd "<jd_path>" --url "<url>" --type cl --path "<pdf path>"`
(and `--type tex` for the `.tex`) — this is what surfaces the letter in the Board/Saved
**detail drawer** (`/api/docs` reads `data/ui/job-docs.jsonl`), even for a *saved-but-not-tracked*
job with no tracker record. ALSO update the tracker `cl_pdf` if a record exists (links it on the Pipeline tab).

Fabricate · put compensation or the user's phone-only context on the letter ·
